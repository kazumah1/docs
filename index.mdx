## What is Model Context Protocol?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a specification for defining and serving AI tools in a standardized, machine-readable format. It abstracts tools as self-describing JSON interfaces with defined input/output schemas and execution semantics. MCP servers expose these tools over HTTP, allowing models or agents to query available capabilities, validate inputs, and invoke execution endpoints. This protocol enables composable, language-agnostic tool integration, facilitates server-side enforcement of tool behavior, and supports dynamic toolchains across LLM and agentic systems.
