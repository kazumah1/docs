# Installation

Our CLI and SDK serve separate but important purposes. For more details, go to the [quickstart](index#quickstart).

### CLI
Use the CLI to connect to MCP servers, generate servers from your repos, and test your servers before deployment
```bash
npm install sigyl-dev/cli@latest
```

### SDK
Use the SDK as a single access point to integrate our wide selection of MCPs to your agents.
```bash
npm install sigyl-dev/sdk@latest
```
