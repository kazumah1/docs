## Connect to servers with Sigyl

There are two ways to connect to the MCP servers on the Sigyl registry: <br/>
1. [App Integration](/docs/app-integration): Install MCPs into your most used apps, such as **Claude Desktop** and **Cursor**
2. [Agent Connect](/docs/agent-connect): Connect the registry MCPs and tools directly to your LLM agents with the Sigyl SDK
